# Personal Data Structure - Binary Tree

Adv. Java with Android Studio S1

The project demonstrates the binary tree data structure. The binary tree is a tree of nodes that link to two children, the left child having smaller values,
the right child having higher values. The binary tree can be printed in different ways: In order traversal, preorder traversal, and post order traversal.
In order traversal prints all the nodes with the lowest value to the highest. The preorder traversal prints nodes, going down the tree, printing the root of the
subtree, then its left and right children. The post order traversel prints left and right children and then the root of each subtree. Add to the tree using a method.
There is also a toString for the node class. There is a search for node method, returning the node with the value that is targeted. There is a removal method that
removes the node.

This project was done entirely by me, utilizing some sites for defining binary trees and videos that explain how some parts are written. I wrote the whole thing in
Java.
